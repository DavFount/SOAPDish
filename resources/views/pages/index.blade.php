            Welcome to The SOAP Dish
        </x-slot:header>

        The SOAP method encourages a deeper dive into scripture than simply
        reading God's word. SOAP is an acronym which means Scripture, Observation,
        Application, Prayer.

            Why SOAP?
        </x-slot:header>
        Spending time with God is the only way to truly become closer to Him. To
        read His words and to live by those words means you must understand what
        is being said. The SOAP method encourages that deeper dive into the word
        by slowing you down and allows you to digest and understand what is being
        said. SOAP can take as little as 15 minutes or as long as you need. We
        provide a toolkit to aid in your study of the Bible. You can share your
        studies with others and help spread the word to those who may not yet be
        saved.
